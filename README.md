Additional manipulation of data included converting the sales and profit columns(represented as text ) into numerical columns and converting such columns as ship date into date fields as well.

## RESULTS
The dataset used for this analysis contains 9,995 records and 21 variables. There were seven missing values which were excluded from the analysis due to the fact they accounted for less than 0.1% of the total dataset and would have no significant impact on the overall data.
A simple pie chart shows that the Consumer segment generated more profit than the corporate and Home office category. This is because 52% of the client population belong this category and majority of products sold are bought by customers in this category. Further analysis shows that majority of the products sold by this company are tailored towards this categoryâ€™s need (accessories,  phones, furnishings etc) and customers tend to buy more than the other categories.

The canon imageCLASS product which belongs to the Technology  class is driving more profit than any other product although it is not the product with the highest quantity being sold
California, New York, and Washington are the top three states that are generating profit. These 3 states have the highest number of customers, quantity of product sold and sales.

States like Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania are generating a negative profit i.e such states are running at a loss even with high number of customers and large number of products being sold. This could be that a large of number of products generating little profit are being sold and customers in this states are not buying expensive products.

Although the highest sales was made in November , more profit was generated in December. The least profit was generated in January, which could be as a result of the aftermath of the holidays.

The phone subcategory has the highest sales and a large number of quantities being sold  but subcategories like copiers generated more profit even when the quantities sold are just few.

Subcategories like tables, bookcases etc are making a lot of sales but generating losses to the company. This could be that these products have been discounted and are being sold below cost price.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
More attention should be given to products that generate more profit for the organization even when such  products are not bought very frequently. This could be achieved by recommending such products to the customers. Carrying out promo sales etc.
